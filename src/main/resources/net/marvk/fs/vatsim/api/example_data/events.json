Not to forget the regular military transports in larger airliners for the close-by Grafenwoehr training area. Pick up your charts, find an IFR route that suits you or just jump into your favorite flying lawnmower and explore the beautiful Franconian countryside with its tons of small airfields to choose from.<\/p><br>",

Not to forget the regular military transports in larger airliners for the close-by Grafenwoehr training area.

It's always a great mixture of mainly holiday-bound mid-range airliners, VFR traffic buzzing through the CTR, a bunch of cargo traffic and business as well as medical flights in smaller jets and props. Not to forget the regular military transports in larger airliners for the close-by Grafenwoehr training area. Pick up your charts, find an IFR route that suits you or just jump into your favorite flying lawnmower and explore the beautiful Franconian countryside with its tons of small airfields to choose from.<\/p><br>",

From 20:00lcl to 22:00lcl (18:00z to 20:00z in the summer and 19:00z to 21:00z in the winter) there will be a mix of old stagers and new trainees controlling for you. Fly from Stuttgart over the Swabian Jura, to Lake Constance or follow the Neckar to the Rhine.

Not to forget the regular military transports in larger airliners for the close-by Grafenwoehr training area.

Not to forget the regular military transports in larger airliners for the close-by Grafenwoehr training area.
